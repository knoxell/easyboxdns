This script might be interesting for you if you need to obtain your external ip address of you Vodafone easybox router e.g. for use with a dyndns script or as a starting point if you want to read other data from your easybox.


# Usage

```bash
% ./getip.sh [easybox address, default: 'easy.box']
[ip address]
% # or
% ./easybox.py [easybox address, default: 'easy.box']
[ip address]
```

# Issues

If there are issues with the script open a issue. As long as I have access to the router, I might be able to help.import

# API

I started to make the code reusable in python, see `easybox.py`, it's not much, but maybe some might be interessted or maybe I pick it up some day.
