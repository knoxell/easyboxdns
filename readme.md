This script may be of interest if you need to obtain the external IP address of your Vodafone easybox router, e.g. for use with a dyndns script, or as a starting point for reading other data from your easybox.


# Usage

```bash
% ./getip.sh [easybox address, default: 'easy.box']
[ip address]
% # or
% ./easybox.py [easybox address, default: 'easy.box']
[ip address]
```

# Issues

If you have any problems with the script, please open an issue. As long as I have access to the router, I might be able to help.

# API

I started to make the code reusable in python, see `easybox.py`, it's not much, but maybe some might be interessted or maybe I pick it up some day.
I've started to make the code reusable as a python class (see `easybox.py`), it's not much, but someone might be interested.
